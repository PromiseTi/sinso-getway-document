SSC Network, as an abbreviation for SINSO SMART CHAIN, is a public chain built by SINSO, in order to better serve the SINSO ecology.

## Why do we need to build SSC access nodes?

The joining of more collaborators and volunteers to the SINSO Network will greatly contribute to the development of the SINSO ecosystem. The more access nodes built, the smoother the network will be, and the faster data interaction will be.

## Will these access nodes bring profits?

At present, the role of the SSC Network is to empower the SINSO ecosystem and promote the SINSO Network. Thus, there is no incentive reward for the current stage.

SSC Network Token: SIN

Currently, SSC Network consumes SIN token as gas. On the SSC network, SIN can be collected for free through the faucet.
